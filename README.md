IT professional for over 10 years, today I work as a developer after a successful career transition from infrastructure to software. I love technology and I'm driven by challenges. Adept at lifelong learning and career in T, I always try to develop my technical and behavioral skills. I have an analytical vision, critical sense and responsibility, in addition to being collaborative, communicative and good people in my spare time.
