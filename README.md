IT professional for 10 years with background in the infrastructure area. In the Information Systems course at PUCPR, I rediscovered my passion for programming. Technology and challenges motivate me, I want to be part of the digital transformation, being a multidisciplinary professional who adds and generates value, building robust and reliable applications. I am communicative, resilient, self-taught and adept at continuous learning. I am currently part of the AceleraDev Java program from Codenation and Hiring Coders from the Gama Academy. I seek internship opportunities or junior developer.
